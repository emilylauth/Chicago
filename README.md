# Create your first webpage

In this assignment we utilized 100% HTML coding to try our hand at making our first rudimentary, informational website of our own topic choice.
## Roadmap

If I revisit this project, it will be to add more functionality. I would like to add a real time bus tracker that I build for Chicago Transit to this site as well.
